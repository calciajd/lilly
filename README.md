# Lilly Pulitzer demo

Improvement to demo app that includes express acting as a simple proxy for API requests. Corrected an error during the initial 3 hour interview and finally got it working as intended.


This app uses angularjs 1.7.8 and nodejs 10.13.0. It run by typing 'node server.js' and then navigating to localhost:8000.

Adding sizes from the variants to each table was next, but time ran out.
